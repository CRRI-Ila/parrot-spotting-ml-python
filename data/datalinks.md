For squirrel I got it from: https://images.cv/dataset/squirrel-image-classification-dataset#google_vignette

For pigeon I got it from: https://images.cv/dataset/pigeon-image-classification-dataset

For macaw I got it from: https://images.cv/dataset/lears-macaw-image-classification-dataset#google_vignette

After this I put 100 images from each data set in a folder and renamed them to their respective labels with python
