The Parrot Spotting ML System is a supervised machine learning project that classifies macaws, pigeons, and squirrels using HOG and colour features. Built with SVM and KNN models, it supports rare bird identification and conservation efforts. The system enables accurate species detection and could be integrated into a real-time wildlife monitoring
