We assessed the performance of each model using precision, recall, F1-score, and support. The KNN classifier produced a test accuracy of around 51.67%. Although the precision, recall, and F1-scores across the classes were moderate, the SVM classifier surpassed it with a test accuracy of 83.33%. The SVM model consistently exceeded the KNN in precision, recall, and F1-score, especially for the “Squirrel” and “Macaw” classes, highlighting its enhanced ability to differentiate between categories. Support values—the counts of instances per class in the test set—were uniform across both classifiers, reinforcing the validity of the performance comparison. Consequently, the SVM classifier clearly proved to be the stronger and more dependable option for the bird image classification task.
