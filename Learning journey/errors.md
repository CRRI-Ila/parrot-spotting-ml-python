I tested the SVM model with some new unknow non labelled data 
Overall, most of them were correct except for 
1.	Image 2 which has a lighter colour of blue that looks Gray and stands in the orientation was like a pigeon
2.	Picture 6 where there is no focal point and there are 2 birds there are a bit of brown and texture on the plat form they are standing on which could have made it think it’s a squirl
3.	Picture 14 when the squirl is standing more upright it also has a small patch of yellow on its thigh which is distinct to the macaw beaks this could have confused the data

Overall it has a accuracy of 12/15 which is Ard 80 per cent accuracy which is like the other result
